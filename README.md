# Machine Learning With Swift

#### I love swift programming language . Here I am capturing my journey to understand and implement Machine Learning /Deep learning using swift.

## Below are the main paths/frameworks for machine learning in swift

- Apple CoreML/CreateML 
	- [Core ML Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)
	- [Create ML Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml)
	- [Accelerate framework Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate)
- Swift for TensorFlow - Ground Up machine learning (Mostly Deep learning)
	- [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift)
- Other Machine learning frameworks written in Swift 
	- Framework Created by Swift AI  - [Github Link](https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet)
