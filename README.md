# Machine Learning With Swift

#### I love swift programming language . Here I am capturing my journey to understand and implement Machine Learning /Deep learning using swift.

## Below are the main paths/frameworks for machine learning in swift

- Apple CoreML/CreateML 
	- [Core ML Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)
	- [Create ML Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml)
	- [Accelerate framework Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate)
- Ground Up machine learning (Mostly Deep learning) with Tensorflow for swift
- Other Machine learning frameworks written in Swift 
	- https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet
