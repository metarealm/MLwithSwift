# Machine Learning With Swift

I love swift programming language . Here I am capturing my journey to understand and implement Machine Learning /Deep learning using swift.

## Below are the main paths/frameworks for machine learning in swift

- Apple CoreML/CreateML 
	- **Core ML** [Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml)
	- **Create ML** [Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml)
	- **Accelerate** [Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate)
	- **Swift Numerics** [Documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics)
- Swift for TensorFlow - Ground Up machine learning (Mostly Deep learning)
	- **Swift for TensorFlow** [Site Link](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) [Github Link](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)
- Other Machine learning frameworks written in Swift 
	- **NeuralNet** Framework Created by Swift AI  - [Github Link](https://github.com/Swift-AI/NeuralNet)
	- **Swift-AI** Framework Created by Swift AI  - [Github Link](https://github.com/Swift-AI/Swift-AI)
	- **Bender** Neural Networks on iOS! TensorFlow models. Metal under the hood. -[Site Link](https://xmartlabs.github.io/Bender/) [Github Link](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Bender)
	- **Braincore** The -  iOS and OS X neural network framework - [Github Link](https://github.com/alejandro-isaza/BrainCore)
	- **SWIX** Swift Matrix and Machine Learning Library - [Site Link](https://stsievert.com/swix/) [Github Link](https://github.com/stsievert/swix)
	- **AItookbox** A toolbox of AI modules written in Swift -[Github Link](https://github.com/KevinCoble/AIToolbox)
	- **MLKit** A simple machine learning framework written in Swift - [Github Link](https://github.com/Somnibyte/MLKit)
	- **Swift-Brain** - [Github Link](https://github.com/vlall/Swift-Brain)
	- **Perfect-TensorFlow** TensorFlow C API Class Wrapper in Swift. [Github Link](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-TensorFlow)
	- **prediction-builder-swift** -Linear Regression - [Github Link](https://github.com/denissimon/prediction-builder-swift)
	
In this Post I will focus mostly on the Apple Core/Create ML framework and the Swift for TensorFlow project from Google. Most of the other initiatives are not updated in last couple of years . I think this is given the fact swift for tensforflow will fill out the gap for auto-diff and neural net in Swift .
